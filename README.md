2. Open Publii, [install or update the theme](https://getpublii.com/docs/installing-using-updating-themes.html#installingatheme) using the ZIP archive downloaded from previous step.
3. In `Site settings`, select `Install and use ➔ Luci` to **install** or **update** the theme. Click `Save Settings` button to apply modification.
4. See [Usage](#usage) for using and configuring the theme.

## Usage

Once the theme is installed, read following sections to know how to use and configure it.

### Adding a portfolio image

The portfolio (index page) is composed of posts with only a `title`, a `featured image` and ensure `Other options ➔ Post template ➔ Image for the portfolio` is set.

This combination will show the picture with a lightbox effect. The `title` is used as the image caption.

### Theme settings

From Publii, navigate to `Theme ➔ Custom settings` to customize the theme behavior.
